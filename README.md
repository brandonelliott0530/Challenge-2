# Brandon Elliott's Working Portfolio

This is my first attempt at creating my portfolio page.

## Contents

The page includes semantic HTML elements, A nav bar with links to the sections of the page, a short biography, and a section about the work that I have done so far. So far, there are only two items that I can put as examples of my work, but I expect that to grow over the coming months, so I placed 4 other placeholder cards in the section as well. The page displays a responsive layout using flexbox and other properties. The page also includes a "contact me" section that has my phone number, email, and a link to my github page.
